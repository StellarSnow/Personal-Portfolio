Dane Dwarka Portfolio
=====================

The main page of my portfolio has:
* A header with my name
* A blurb about who I am
* Four to six buttons.  Each button is a square anchor.  Clicking on it takes you to another page of the website
* Whenever I get something new I can just add another button
* A footer with a different quote every time you visit the page.  These are stored in an array

It will be mobile first. At phone resolution, the buttons will stack on top each other.  At tablet they will be in columns of two.  At desktop they will be two rows of 3.

The buttons may be circle-shaped instead of squares.  I want each button to grow when the user mouses over it on desktop.
