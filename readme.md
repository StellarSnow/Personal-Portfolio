Dane Dwarka Portfolio
=====================

This is my personal portfolio. I am currently a student in a Software Developer program. I hope to make vast improvements to my portfolio as I learn new things.

The index page has 4 big buttons taking the user to the rest of the site.

Future plans for the index page:

- Use CSS animation to fly the buttons from the bottom to the top of the screen
- Resize the buttons to make them look nicer on multiple resolutions
- Add buttons linking to other pages of this site

The rest of the pages have a different format. There is an:

- About Page
- Blog Page - four blog entries
- Contact Page - submit button does not work yet
- Projects Page - Some assignments I have completed
