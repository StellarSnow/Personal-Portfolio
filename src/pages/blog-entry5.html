      <h2 class="blog-title">My Samsung Galaxy S7 Still Works Just Fine</h2>
      <p>Dane Dwarka <span class="publish-date">published on April 15, 2022</span></p>
      <p>I bought my Samsung Galaxy S7 (S7) when it was released in spring of 2016.  I have had it for 6 years and it still works great.  
      This blog posts covers the current strengths and weaknesses of my phone.</p>
      <h3>Battery Life</h3>
      <p>If I use my phone for a few phone calls, a couple of Internet searches, watching YouTube, etc. then I can get 
      2 days of battery life from it.  If I use my phone excessively then it lasts for 1 day.</p>
      <h3>Operating System</h3>
      <p>The S7 runs the Android operating system.  It was launched with Android version 6 and was upgraded to 
      Android version 8.  Samsung stopped updating the operating system in 2020. The S7 is still useful with Android version 8.  
      Androidâ€™s current version is 12.</p>
      <h3>Useful Apps</h3>
      <p>Many apps still work even though my phone is 6 years old and has an outdated operating system.</p>
      <p>Here are the apps I use:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Facebook</li>
        <li>YouTube</li>
        <li>Instagram</li>
        <li>Samsung Internet</li>
        <li>Samsung Music</li>
        <li>Camera</li>
        <li>Voice Recorder</li>
        <li>Weather widget</li>
        <li>Google Maps</li>
        <li>WhatsApp</li>
        <li>Microsoft Word</li>
        <li>Email</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These apps work as effectively as the first day I bought my phone.</p>
      <h3>Internal Storage</h3>
      <p>My S7 came with 32 GB of internal storage.  System/User data takes up 22 GB of space.  
      I had a 64 GB SD memory card installed to gain more space.  Pictures, videos, music, 
      and documents are now stored on the SD card.</p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>My Samsung Galaxy S7 is 6 years old and still going strong.  Although the battery may only last a day, 
      my phone still works well for me.  I can post on Facebook, watch and comment on YouTube videos, 
      find places with Google Maps, use email, etc.  I plan to keep my phone for at least another year.</p>
