  <main>
    <p>My name is Dane Dwarka.  I was born in Trinidad, lived in Ottawa for a few years, and then moved to Winnipeg.  I have lived in Winnipeg for most of my life.</p>

    <p>I graduated from Red River College (now called Red River College Polytechnic) in 2005 with honours from the Computer Analyst/Programmer Diploma program.  I worked as a computer programmer for several years.  I am currently a full time student in a Software Developer program to upgrade my skills.</p>

    <p>I like to play chess.  I have a membership at chess.com which is an online chess community.</p>

    <p>I also do some cooking.  My ethnic background is West Indian and Iâ€™ve been trying to learn that cuisine.</p>
