      <h2 class="blog-title">Password Management</h2>
      <p>Dane Dwarka <span class="publish-date">published on March 13, 2022</span></p>
      <p>Do you use many social media websites?  Are you worried about your username and passwords (login information) getting stolen?  
      If you answered yes then I have a solution for you. </p>
      <p>Do not store your login information in a personal profile.</p>
      <p>Modern browsers support personal profiles.  These personal profiles allow you to save login information for websites.  
      If you use your personal profile on another computer then you have access to your login information.  
      This lets you visit your social media sites without having to manually login.</p>
      <p>You must log out of your personal profile when you are done using another computer.  If you don’t then the next person 
      who comes along has access to your profile.  They can view all of your social media sites without logging in because your personal 
      profile already has the login information.  They can also change the login information to their own email address and password, 
      preventing you from accessing your information.</p>
      <p>You can avoid this by not using a personal profile. Put your login information in a spreadsheet.  
      You can sort the spreadsheet in alphabetical order to access information faster.  Although it is a pain to open the spreadsheet every 
      time you login to a site, it is more secure.</p>
      <p>Do not store this spreadsheet in the cloud.  If someone accesses your cloud then they also have access to your passwords.</p>
      <p>This method has a major weakness.  Your spreadsheet is only located on your computer.  If you use another computer then you 
      won’t be able to login to your social media sites because you won't have any of the passwords (unless you memorised them.)</p>
      <p>You can store a copy of this spreadsheet on your cell phone or a USB drive.</p>
