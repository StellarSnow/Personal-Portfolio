    <section>
      <p>Use Cherub’s Phalanx ability while breaching to prevent damage to your squad.</p>
      <p>Your squad deploys to the bottom of the map with your APC on the top of the map.</p>

    <section>
      <p>Move Cherub and the VIP along the bottom/right side of the map taking cover behind the barricades and burnt out cars. 
      Cherub must use his Kinetic Shield to protect the VIP.</p>
      <p>Move Godmother along the same path as Cherub.  You must eventually move her into the middle of the map.</p>
      <p>Move Zephyr and Axion along the left/top side of the map taking cover where possible.</p>
      <p>Move the VIP to the top right hand corner behind the flat bed truck as in this diagram:</p>

    <section>
      <p>Dash the VIP to the exit when possible.  Ending the VIP’s turn on the exit lets you evacuate them immediately. 
      The mission objective is satisfied when the VIP is evacuated.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>The following lists one or more actions that your squad members should take on their turn.</p>
      <p>Zephyr should:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use Parry after killing someone.</li>
        <li>Use Momentum to kill someone and then dash to the exit.</li>
        <li>Use Momentum to kill a flanking enemy and then take cover.</li>
        <li>Use the ceasefire grenade on enemies.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Axiom should:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use Psych Up at the start of his turn.</li>
        <li>Smash enemies if he is out of ammunition.</li>
        <li>Use the mobile inducer to move another squad member into a good position.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Cherub should:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use Kinetic Shield to protect the VIP.  If the VIP is unavailable then use it to protect someone else.</li>
        <li>Use Charged Bash if he is out of ammunition and can’t reload his pistol.</li>
        <li>Use the flashbang grenade to protect squad members from enemies.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Godmother should:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Outflank enemies and attack them.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>All squad members should:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Try to kill or wound an enemy each turn.</li>
        <li>Move slowly toward the exit.</li>
        <li>Dash for the exit when possible.  Evacuate them when they land on the exit.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>You cannot kill all the enemies on this map because of their perpetual reinforcements.  You must evacuate as much of your squad as possible.</p>
      <p>I hope this guide helps you beat Operation Howling God.</p>
